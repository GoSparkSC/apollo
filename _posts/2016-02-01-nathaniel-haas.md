In an incredible outpouring of school spirit and pride in the Trojan family, one could make 

a compelling case for taking a substantial student loan to attend the University of Southern 

California. I hear this every time I walk past a tour of prospective students, and I know this 

because come May 15, I too will be a product of a fantastic USC experience, one I wouldn't 

trade for anything else. 

USC is unlike any other school in the country, but I'll let others make the more elaborate 

version of that argument. What I'm concerned about, and what parents of future college 

students should be, too, are two bigger questions: First, is the cost of any college education 

worth the price? Second, if the answer to question one is “no,” is it fixable? 

According to College Board statistics, the average price tag for a private college during the 

2014-2015 school year (housing excluded) was $31,231. Out-of-state tuition at public 

universities also approached this number, averaging $22,958. According to economists at 

the New York Federal Reserve, Americans now hold more student loan debt ($870 billion) 

than they do credit card debt ($693 billion) and auto loans ($730 billion). 7 in 10 

graduating seniors in the class of 2013 had loans that averaged close to $30,000 per 

student, according to the Institute for College Access and affordability. Those loans usually 

take ten years and 120 monthly payments to pay back.

All things considered, the piece of paper me and a few million other students are going to 

receive in four weeks' time is an awfully expensive one. Why? 

Explaining the cost, and particularly the rise (three times as fast as the consumer price 

index and twice as fast as medical care in the last ten years) in tuition at certain 

universities is a complicated task. While the boost at most public universities, including 

community colleges, can be attributed to a decrease in state and local funding, this article 

will focus on tuition increases at private and large, public research universities, for which 

public funding is a very small part of the problem. In a ten part series grouchily titled, “The 

Tuition is Too Damn High,” the Washington Post laid out a pretty clear picture, and basically 

concluded that large, public research universities and their private counterparts are 

increasing spending in record amounts, and increasing tuition to fund it. 

Despite this, it still might be worth it for some students to take on a loan of epic 

proportions to attend USC, but it by no means indicates they should have to do that, and it 

especially does not mean they will. In economics, we call this opportunity cost: if I hadn't 

gotten a substantial amount of financial aid from USC, for example, I would have gone to 

the University of Nevada at Reno, and paid in-state tuition, costing a fraction of what it 

would have required to attend USC. Sure, someone deep in the USC admissions department 

might have shed a tear at my choice, but they would never consider altering tuition because 

of it. They know someone is lined up to take my spot in line, as soon as I step out. 

Therein lies the problem. The price of a good, whether it is a pencil or a college education, 

is determined by the willingness of consumers to pay for it. If no one is buying pencils at 

$10 a pop, the company selling them will either go out of business or lower its price. The 

Washington Post devoted three installments of its series to make recommendations for 

private and large public research universities to save money and reduce tuition, but in 

doing so missed an important point: perhaps the reason tuition is so damn high is because 

there is always someone willing to pay for it, and private universities and their large public 

counterparts know it. 

Or, as the Post put it in an earlier installment:

“Consumers aren’t being dumb here. They’re being rational. While the upfront price of 

college was increasing, so were the benefits. The result is that college is pretty much as 

good a deal today as it was in the past.”

This lines up nicely with recent data. In Education Economics, Katharina Best and Justin 

Keppo developed a model that measured the change in enrollment for higher education as 

it relates to the benefits of a college education, credit factors, and financial aid. They found 

that when it comes to higher tuition, the demand for college doesn’t change if that upped 

price tag is tied to better appeal of the university. Similarly, they found that students don’t 

respond to higher tuition by going somewhere else, they respond by borrowing.   

As early as 1987, people like Secretary or Education William Bennet, Jr. were suggesting 

that more federal financial aid, in the form of grants and easily accessible student loans, 

was creating a cycle of increased tuition prices. In line with the so-called “Bennet 

Hypothesis,” perhaps universities don't charge so much because they have to. They do it 

because they can. 

In his state of USC address this year, President C.L. Max Nikias defended USC and others 

from critics who have taken a stand against rising tuition. He noted that while USC’s tuition 

has doubled since 1984, so has its prestige as a research university. Sure, with some belt 

tightening, USC could knock down the cost of tuition a little bit, but by Nikias-logic, it would 

lost prestige from research work—and with a loss of prestige comes a loss of demand in 

students willing to pay enormous loans to go here. Do you see the cycle? 

The short answer: USC, and any other college, is worth the going price is because the price 

is determined by what people are willing to pay (either out of pocket or through loans). Just 

like when we graduate college, the wages for certain jobs will go up or down based on how 

many people will work for a certain salary. Similarly, once colleges determine their 

enrollment targets, they adjust the price of tuition over the years to capture just enough 

students who are willing to pay. 

The only way college is going to become more “worth it” is if the price goes down, which is 

unlikely, or if student loans become easier to pay back. That’s why politicians have 

dedicated so much energy to latter, and not the former. It’s also why college prices won’t 

really go down unless a massive movement (that will never happen) to boycott colleges 

forces administrations’ hands. In terms of rankings, the USC administration is painfully 

aware that our needle with US News and World Report’s rankings seems to be stuck in the 

mid 20’s. To move it, the theory goes, attract better students—and hence, USC offers huge 

financial aid every year, a fact Nikias reminded listeners totals $300 million per year, the 

largest in the nation. 

That’s something to be proud of, but it’s also some rubber that will meet the road when 

(and I don't dare say, 'if') USC cracks the ranking’s top ten list. Admissions demand will 

skyrocket, and many will line up to pay high prices. Temptation will certainly rise to 

nourish the positive feedback loop and funnel some of that huge financial aid budget to 

more lavish amenities and more expansive research buildings, and to encourage future 

donors to do the same. Bye bye financial aid, hello more tuition revenue. 

This absolutely cannot happen. USC can’t forget where it came from and what it currently 

stands for—making college affordable with the biggest financial aid program in the nation. 

If that goes away following a corresponding ascent in national rankings, USC will be just 

like any other school in the country. And being just like any other school isn’t worth 

$55,000 a year.
